The RAMS Project
=======

The RAMS (Registration And Management System) Project is a web app written in Python and designed for high customization to suit event's needs. It's aimed largely at fandom events and can track things like registration, events, staffers, groups, dealers, jobs, game checkouts, etc.

This app was originally developed by [MAGFest](http://magfest.org) as their internal registration system, named UberSystem, and is now open source and available for anyone to use. This is the community edition, known simply as RAMS. Eternal thanks to [Eli Courtwright](https://github.com/EliAndrewC) for tirelessly developing UberSystem for ten years.
