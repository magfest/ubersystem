<h3 align="center"> Group Registrations </h3>

If you preregister a group of eight or more people for MAGFest, you save $10 per badge!

<br/> <br/>

After you register, you'll be able to fill in the names of your group members.
This is optional, but it will speed the process of picking up your badges at MAGFest.
A member of the group whose name is already in our database
(such as the person who registered the group) must be present when unassigned badges
are picked up.

<br/> <br/>

No refunds will be given for unused badges, but badges may be transferred to other
attendees, even if those badges are already assigned to a specific
person.  So if someone in your group can't make it, simply come to the registration desk
and tell us you'd like to transfer that badge, and we'll do so free of charge.
