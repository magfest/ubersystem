<h3 align="center"> Affiliates </h3>

We like to know who our <a href="supporters.html">Supporters</a> are and what other 
gaming communities they strongly identify with.  So we allow you to choose a group,
such as OCRemix or ScrewAttack, so we'll know which of these groups' fans are strongly
supporting us.

<br/> <br/>

If we see a lot of Supporters identifying with a specific group, we can put the
money from those registrations into things which that group will find important.
We might also find some extra-special swag that will be meaningful to that group.

<br/> <br/>

You can choose one of the default affiliate groups, enter a new one, or ignore this
completely.
