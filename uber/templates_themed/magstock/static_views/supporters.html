<h3 align="center"> Supporter Badges </h3>

For years we've offered a special Supporter registration as a way for dedicated fans of
{{ EVENT_NAME }} to give us a little extra cash to help make the event better.  {%  comment %}This is now
offered as one of our <a href="givingExtra.html">donation levels</a>. and you'll get all
of the extra swag we've always given.{% endcomment %}

The main things you get as a Supporter are a special swag bag and a cool customized badge.
As with all donation levels, you still get all of the swag from the lower donation levels,
and if you donate at a higher level, you still get the Supporter package.
