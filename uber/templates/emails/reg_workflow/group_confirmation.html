Your {{ group.is_dealer|yesno(c.DEALER_REG_TERM + ",group") }} ({{ group.name }}) has been preregistered for
{{ c.EVENT_NAME }} this coming {{ event_dates() }}{% if group.cost > 0 %} and your payment of {{ (group.amount_paid / 100)|format_currency }} has been received{% endif %}.

{% if group.unregistered_badges %}
    <br/> <br/>
    Some of your badges are not yet assigned to a specific person. If you assign these badges
    now then it will take much less time for their owners to pick them up at the event. Preassigning
    badges also allows individual members of your group to preorder merch or donate
    extra money. You may preassign your badges on your
    <a href="{{ c.URL_BASE }}/preregistration/group_members?id={{ group.id }}">group management page</a>.
    The individual registration links on the group management page can be filled out by you, or distributed
    to your group members for them to fill out themselves.

    <b>Your</b> registration confirmation number is {{ group.leader_id }}, and you can update your information, preorder merch,
    or donate extra money <a href="{{ c.URL_BASE }}/preregistration/confirm?id={{ group.leader_id }}">here</a>.

    {% if not group.is_dealer and group.cost > 0 %}
        <br/> <br/>
        You can add badges to your group using the above link, but you must add
        at least {{ c.MIN_GROUP_ADDITION }} badges at a time.
    {% endif %}
{% endif %}

{% if c.CONSENT_FORM_URL and group.leader.age_group_conf['consent_form'] %}
    <br/> <br/>
    Because you are under 18, you must bring a <a href="{{ c.CONSENT_FORM_URL }}">signed and notarized parental
    consent form</a> to be granted admission to {{ c.EVENT_NAME }}.
    <br/> <br/>
    If you are over 18, update your date of birth on your
     <a href="{{ c.URL_BASE }}/preregistration/confirm?id={{ group.leader.id }}">badge confirmation page</a>.
{% endif %}

<br/> <br/>
Badges are not mailed out before the event, so your group members may pick up their badge at the
registration desk when they arrive at {{ c.EVENT_NAME }}. Inform your group to bring a photo ID{{ c.EXTRA_CHECKIN_DOCS }} to the registration
desk, where they'll be provided with their badge. If anyone in your group pre-ordered a t-shirt or other merch package,
they can pick those up at our merchandise booth. The location and
hours of the registration desk and merchandise booth will be emailed prior to the event.
<br/> <br/>
You can always <a href="{{ c.URL_BASE }}/preregistration/group_members?id={{ group.id }}">use this link</a> to manage your group.
