You have successfully registered group "{{ group.name }}" for {{ c.EVENT_NAME }} this coming {{ event_dates() }} and your payment of {{ (group.buyer.amount_paid / 100)|format_currency }} has been received. Your group has {{ group.promo_codes|length|int + 1 }} badges, including your own.

<br/><br/>
Group badges are allocated using promo codes: your group members will simply enter a promo code <a href="{{ c.URL_BASE }}/preregistration/">while preregistering</a> to claim a badge in your group.
You can either allocate specific promo codes for each group member using your <a href="{{ c.URL_BASE }}/preregistration/group_promo_codes?id={{ group.id }}">group management page</a> or distribute your group's universal promo code ("{{ group.code }}"), which will let people claim badges in your group until it has no more available badges.

<br/><br/>
You may edit your own registration <a href="{{ c.URL_BASE }}/preregistration/confirm?id={{ group.buyer.id }}">here</a>.

{% if c.CONSENT_FORM_URL and group.buyer.age_group_conf['consent_form'] %}
    <br/> <br/>
    Because you are under 18, you must bring a <a href="{{ c.CONSENT_FORM_URL }}">signed and notarized parental
    consent form</a> to be granted admission to {{ c.EVENT_NAME }}.
    <br/> <br/>
    If you are over 18, update your date of birth on your
    <a href="{{ c.URL_BASE }}/preregistration/confirm?id={{ group.leader.id }}">badge confirmation page</a>.
{% endif %}

<br/> <br/>
Badges are not mailed out before the event, so your group members may pick up their badge at the
registration desk when they arrive at {{ c.EVENT_NAME }}. Inform your group to bring a photo ID{{ c.EXTRA_CHECKIN_DOCS }} to the registration
desk, where they'll be provided with their badge. If anyone in your group pre-orders a t-shirt or other merch package,
they can pick those up at our merchandise booth. The location and
hours of the registration desk and merchandise booth will be emailed prior to the event.
