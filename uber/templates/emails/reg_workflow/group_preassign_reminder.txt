Our records indicate that your group ({{ group.name|safe }}) currently has some unassigned badges.  It is imperative you assign these badges before the event. If someone from your group attempts to pick up a badge before it is assigned to them, they will be instructed to contact you to assign the badge to them so they can pick it up. We cannot assign them a badge unless you are present.

If you already know who's coming with your group, we highly encourage you to use the following link to pre-assign your badges: {{ c.URL_BASE }}/preregistration/group_members?id={{ group.id }}

The latest that you can pre-assign your badges is {{ c.UBER_TAKEDOWN|datetime_local }}.  We look forward to seeing you at {{ c.EVENT_NAME }} on {{ event_dates() }}.
