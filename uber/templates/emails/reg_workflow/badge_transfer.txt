{{ old.first_name }} and {{ new.first_name }},

Our records indicate that {{ old.full_name }} ({{ old.email }}) has transferred their {{ c.EVENT_NAME }} {{ old.badge_type_label }} registration to {{ new.full_name }} ({{ new.email }}).  So {{ old.full_name }} no longer has a paid registration, and {{ new.full_name }} should have no trouble picking up the badge at our registration desk.

If {{ new.full_name }} needs to add or update the information associated with their new badge, use this link: {{ c.URL_BASE }}/preregistration/confirm?id={{ new.id }}

Badges are not mailed out before the event, so your badge will be available for pickup at the registration desk when you arrive at {{ c.EVENT_NAME }}. Simply bring a photo ID to the registration desk, where you'll be provided with your badge. If you ordered bonus items such as a ribbon, t-shirt, or supporter package, you can pick those up at our merchandise booth. The location and hours of the registration desk and merchandise booth will be e-mailed prior to the event. {% if c.CONSENT_FORM_URL and new.age_group_conf['consent_form'] %}

Our records indicate that {{ new.full_name }} is under the age of 18, and as such, will need a signed parental consent form. If a parent/guardian will be present at {{ c.EVENT_NAME }}, then they can sign the consent form when you pick up your badge at the registration desk. If a parent/guardian will not be at the event, the form may be brought pre-signed, however it MUST be notarized. We will not accept pre-signed forms that are not notarized. You may find the form at {{ c.CONSENT_FORM_URL }}.

If you are actually over 18, you can update your age in our database at {{ c.URL_BASE }}/preregistration/confirm?id={{ new.id  }} before {{ c.UBER_TAKEDOWN|datetime_local }}.
{% endif %}

If this has happened in error, please contact {{ c.REGDESK_EMAIL|safe }}.  Otherwise we look forward to seeing {{ new.first_name }} on {{ event_dates() }}.
