Thanks for pre-registering for {{ c.EVENT_NAME }}. Our records indicate that you are under the age of 18, and as such, you will need a signed parental consent form. If a parent/legal guardian will be present at {{ c.EVENT_NAME }}, then they can sign the consent form when you pick up your badge at the registration desk. If a parent/legal guardian will not be at the event, the form may be brought pre-signed, however it MUST be notarized. We will not accept pre-signed forms that are not notarized. You may find the form at {{ c.CONSENT_FORM_URL }}.

If you are actually over 18, please update your age in our database at {{ c.URL_BASE }}/preregistration/confirm?id={{ attendee.id }} prior to picking up your badge.

We look forward to seeing you at {{ c.EVENT_NAME_AND_YEAR }}!
