As a department head or checklist admin for {{ attendee.get_labels_for_memberships('dept_memberships_where_can_admin_checklist')|readable_join }} we need some information from you about: {{ conf.name|safe }}
{% if conf.full_description %}
{{ conf.full_description|safe }}{% endif %}{% if conf.slug == 'approve_setup_teardown' %}

Approvals here will affect setup/teardown permissions for your volunteers.
{% endif %}

Please complete the following steps by {{ conf.deadline|datetime_local }}:

{% for membership in attendee.dept_memberships_as_checklist_admin -%}
* {{ conf.name }}: {{ c.URL_BASE }}{{ conf|dept_checklist_path(membership.department_id) }}
{% endfor %}{% if conf.slug == 'creating_shifts' %}

If you need us to import your shifts from last time, let us know at {{ c.STAFF_EMAIL|email_only }}.

{% endif %}

We need you to check and complete each step even if this doesn't apply to your department so that we know you've looked at it.

You can review the complete checklist of all information we'll eventually need from you at {{ c.URL_BASE }}/dept_checklist
