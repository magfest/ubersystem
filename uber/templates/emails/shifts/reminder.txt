{{ attendee.first_name }},

Thanks again for signing up to volunteer at {{ c.EVENT_NAME }}!  You are not currently signed up for any shifts. It is really helpful for us when our volunteers and staff sign up for shifts in advance, since that allows us to know that we might be short-staffed in some areas.

Please sign up for shifts at {{ c.URL_BASE }}/staffing/login?first_name={{ attendee.first_name|urlencode }}&last_name={{ attendee.last_name|urlencode }}&email={{ attendee.email|urlencode }}&zip_code={{ attendee.zip_code|urlencode }} -- if you need to, you can verify/update your personal information at {{ c.URL_BASE }}/preregistration/confirm?id={{ attendee.id }}

After {{ c.DROP_SHIFTS_DEADLINE.astimezone(c.EVENT_TIMEZONE).strftime('%B %-e') }}, you cannot drop shifts, but you can continue to sign up for shifts through the event.

Please let us know if you have any questions.
