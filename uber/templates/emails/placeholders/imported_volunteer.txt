{% endif %}Hey all! Weâ€™re so excited to see you at {{ c.EVENT_NAME }}! You're eligible for a complimentary badge for the next event, which will be {{ c.EPOCH|datetime_local }}. You can accept your badge by visiting {{ c.URL_BASE }}/preregistration/confirm?id={{ attendee.id }}

At this stage, you can apply to volunteer again this year. By default, the checkbox labeled "Yes, I want to staff {{ c.EVENT_NAME }}." is toggled ON, which means that you'll automatically be enrolled. If you are not interested in applying to volunteer again, you can uncheck that box (toggle it OFF), and your badge will be set to a complimentary Attendee Badge (instead of Volunteer Badge).

If accepted, you'll be emailed when your Volunteer Checklist launches. The Checklist will need to be completed before the event starts, and will have a link to our volunteering guidelines and agreement. 

Please let us know if you have any questions.
