You ({{ attendee.full_name }}) deferred your attendee badge last year, so we have created a placeholder badge for you for 
{{ c.EVENT_NAME_AND_YEAR }} this coming {{ event_dates() }}. 
Please <a href="{{ c.URL_BASE }}/preregistration/confirm?id={{ attendee.id }}">click here to claim your badge</a>, 
make sure your information is up-to-date.

<br/><br/>Badges are not mailed out before the event, so your badge will be available for pickup at the registration desk when 
you arrive at {{ c.EVENT_NAME }}. Bring a photo ID{{ c.EXTRA_CHECKIN_DOCS }}
to the registration desk, where you'll be provided with your badge.
{% if c.DONATIONS_ENABLED %} If you pre-order a t-shirt or other merch package, you can pick those up at our merchandise booth.
The location and hours of the registration desk and merchandise booth will be emailed prior to the event.{% endif %}
