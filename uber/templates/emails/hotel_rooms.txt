You're eligible for space in one of our volunteer hotel rooms at this year's MAGFest!  If you accept, we'll assign you to a room with 3 - 4 other volunteers.  You can accept or decline this offer as part of our volunteer checklist at {{ URL_BASE }}/signups/login
{% if attendee.hotel_requests %}
Our records indicate that you've already filled out the hotel room form, so thanks for jumping on that so quickly!  You can edit the hotel room form anytime until {{ ROOM_DEADLINE|datetime }}.
{% else %}
If you want hotel room space, you must sign up by {{ ROOM_DEADLINE|datetime }}.
{% endif %}
All volunteers who receive hotel room space must sign up for at least 30 weighted hours worth of shifts, but you won't be charged any money.  Volunteers who help with setup or teardown before or after MAGFest do not need to sign up for 30 weighted hours in advance, because so much of their work consists of be non-shift hours.

Please let us know if you have any questions.
