You still haven't told us whether or not you want space in one of our volunteer hotel room at the upcoming {{ c.EVENT_NAME }}.  If you accept, you'll be assigned to a hotel room with 3 - 4 other volunteers.  You can accept or decline this offer as part of our volunteer checklist at {{ c.URL_BASE }}/staffing/login?first_name={{ attendee.first_name|urlencode }}&last_name={{ attendee.last_name|urlencode }}&email={{ attendee.email|urlencode }}&zip_code={{ attendee.zip_code|urlencode }}

If you don't sign up by {{ c.ROOM_DEADLINE|datetime_local }} then you will not receive hotel room space.

All volunteers who receive hotel room space must sign up for at least {{ c.HOURS_FOR_HOTEL_SPACE }} weighted hours worth of shifts, but you won't be charged any money.  Let us know if you're interested in helping with setup and/or teardown shifts for {{ c.EVENT_NAME }}, and if we haven't already selected enough volunteers to help, you'll be approved for the extra night(s). Your department head will have to approve the extra nights and those shifts can count towards the {{ c.HOURS_FOR_HOTEL_SPACE }} hour requirement.

If you have trouble with the login information, please go to: {{ c.URL_BASE }}/preregistration/confirm?id={{ attendee.id }} and verify your registration information.

Please let us know if you have any questions.
