<br/><br/>Hello! Here is a list of information that may be helpful to you as MAGFest approaches.

<h4>Location/Layout</h4>

<p>Riverfront Ballroom 1 and 2. In the location we have a little more than enough single tables for each team to have one if all are presenting at the same time.</p>

<p>The room opens at noon Thursday and closes for good on Sunday at 6pm Sunday. Between that, each night the room will ‘close’ at 6pm and open again at 10am. We will try to allow you to start setting up at 10am on Thursday, but that will depend on is the room is ready for that.</p>

<p>This year we will need you to take your belongings with you when you leave. I know this is a pain, but the walkway to the 24/7 free play area is through MITS, so we cannot guarantee the safety of unattended property. The upside to this is free publicity from the traffic.</p>

<p>Firecode is very important to us. If you have a banner or other large promotional item, you may either leave if in the hallway before MITS, or pick a wall or corner table with enough room to facilitate the banner. You may not block doors or egress paths with your belongings, and if there is a mistake in firecode, you will be asked to move your items, or if we cannot find you your items will be moved.</p>

<p>Table choice is first come first served. Because we ask you to take your things with you, you may not reserve a table when you aren't there. It's also more fair to other teams that if you aren't in the room that they can use their choice of table. There may be a small area to store your things when you aren't present, but MAGFest is not responsible for those items.</p>

<p>I've had many requests for additional tables, but unfortunately each team will only be guaranteed one at a time. What I can tell you is that it's very rare for each team to present at the same time, which means there will be extra tables sometimes. If there is an extra table, each team may use 1 extra table at a time. If the room is mostly empty, you may use as many as you like. There are 2 things about this though. Don't be greedy! If the room is almost full and you see 2 extra tables, please be considerate that other teams may want to utilize that space, and that other teams may be about to set up.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>If teams come in and there are no tables, you will be asked to clear off your extra tables for them to present.</li>
    <li>You are not permitted to change the room layout. This means you cannot move the tables at all. This is because we have to have the layout approved by the hotel for firecode reasons.</li>
  </ol>

<h4>Selling</h4>

<p>An automated email will be coming out with the tax form for MAGFest, if you checked interested in selling in the form. You must fill out the form BEFORE MAGFEST to sell at MITS. You are only allowed to sell your game or merch related to your game or team. Tax code is important, and if you're caught selling without having filled it out, you will have your badge and MITS privileges revoked.</p>

<p>If you choose to give out anything, you may give out anything you're legally allowed to, including food, so long as it isn't and energy drink or alcoholic beverage, even if you didn't click interested in selling.</p>

<h4>Badges</h4>

<p>Please insure that each of your team members that did not already have a badge has received the email for the badge, and that they have registered through that email. Any badge marked reimbursed should be reimbursed either before or after MAGFest. Please check after a couple of weeks after MAGFest to insure that any badge that is supposed to be reimbursed will have been by then. Keep in mind that processes like this can take a while to go through sometimes.</p>

<h4>Contacting us</h4>

<p>During MAGFest George will be onsite during the 10am-6pm ‘open’ hours. If you have any questions or concerns that need to be addressed ASAP he will be your first point of contact.</p>

<h4>Rooms (Sleeping Accommodations)</h4>

<p>We have several rooms set aside for any teams that need them. Please fill out the form at this link: <a href="https://registration.experientevent.com/showMFS251/Flow/Guest?cac=Others#!/registrant//Dashboard/" target="_blank">Hotel Rooms</a></p>

<p>If you have any issues with this form or are unable to fill it out today, let us know ASAP and we will do our best to accommodate you.</p>

<h4>Dealing with People</h4>

<p>If you have a problem with an attendee or other team, you must contact the MITS attendant. There is one scheduled for all hours of MITS. You are not MAGFest staff, or in the rare case that you are also MAGFest staff, you are not staffing MITS while presenting your game.</p>

<p>If there are no open tables, ask the attendant, they will ask a team to clear an extra table for you.</p>

<p>There is no 'free play' allowed in the MITS room during MITS hours. 'Free Play' is what we call the area where people can rent out games and play them. When MITS closes for the night, we may allow Free Play from 4am to 10am in that area. This is another case where you will need to contact the MITS attendant if you run into a problem. You are not authorized to ask a free play table to leave.</p>

<h4>Guidebook/Website</h4>

<p>We have all of the information into guidebook, and we're working on the website right now. If you'd like to add different images to go on the website, please upload those to the form immediately. Every team will be on the guidebook whether they are showcasing or not.</p>

<h4>Panels</h4>

<p>MITS has no control over which panels are accepted or anything to do with panels, please contact panels@magfest.org with any questions.</p>

<h4>MPoints</h4>

<p>We are giving a small number of MPoints to each team this year. These are intended to be given out to attendees for trying out your game, but it's up to you how you give them out. Also they will be given to us in aliquots, so expect a small number each day you present. This means that if you are presenting fewer days, you will have fewer to give out.</p>

<h4>Donating a Copy</h4>

<p>We encourage you to donate a copy of your game to our library. This means you will get free promotion of your game as people pick it up to play it. You may also lend us a copy of your game. MAGFest is not responsible for lost or stolen games or parts of games.</p>

<p>If you do donate a copy, and it has a market value, the attendants at the games library have a tax form if you want to write it off.</p>

<p>Please forward any MITS related questions you may have to MITS@magfest.org. I look forward to helping you all provide an awesome experience this year!</p>

<p>Thanks for your time.
