Congratulations!  Your game submission ({{ game.title }}) has been chosen to be part of the {{ c.ESCHATON.year }} MAGFest Indie Videogame Showcase (MIVS).

*** You now need to either CONFIRM or DECLINE your acceptance! ***

You have until {{ game.studio.confirm_deadline|datetime_local }} to confirm (or decline).

*** Dropping Out

After accepting your spot, we understand something may happen which may prevent you or your team from participating in the event.

Deciding to not show up at MAGFest without contacting us will impact you at future events.
