Ahoy {{ game.studio.primary_contact_first_names }},

Congrats on presenting at the MAGFest Indie Videogame Showcase! 

We want to know if you would like to run a Leaderboard Challenge or Tournament at the Showcase.

* To run a Leaderboard Challenge, your game should have a way to track a high score, distance, or highest level of some sort.

* To run a Tournament, your game should contain some sort of head to head / versus mode where a Single Elimination bracket can be used. These would be run at your booth currently.

* There are also opportunities to possibly have your game at The Versus Show or, if your game can be used for a speed run, magFAST. If you do want to explore these options, please note that in your reply email and we can further discuss details. 

If you are interested, please email mivs@magfest.org expressing your interest by the end of the day Sunday, November 23rd.

Forever your Fan,
