Ahoy {{ game.studio.primary_contact_first_names }},

Setup begins today for MAGFest! 

When you arrive, you may go directly into hall C.  You do not need a badge. 

The 2023 MIVS Indie Handbook has tons of information on Load In/Out (Section 4.20+): https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ecxBjipQH22o1Jewsa6_PmdBPYcwAo7OvgdYvlnxAUk/

If you need help onsite:

1. Come to the MIVS Operations booth in the center of Expo Hall C

2. Ask for help via the MIVS/IA Discord MIVS -> #help channel

3. Text or call the MIVS DH Hotline: 650-485-1785 - this number is connected to the MIVS Department Heads who can help when they arrive onsite

4. Email mivs@magfest.org and one of the MIVS Staffers will get back to you asap

Please ensure your team is on the MIVS/IA Discord ( https://discord.com/invite/WK7F6DH7Ng ) and be sure to put your game name in your name for the server.

Thank you and see everyone soon!

Forever your Fan,
The MIVS Team
