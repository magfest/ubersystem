Hello {{ game.studio.primary_contact_first_names }},

Here is a December update with general reminders and new information for the upcoming {{c.EVENT_YEAR}} MAGFest Indies hall!


### Communication - Discord Server

Reminder that we have a private Discord server which helps us disseminate quick communications, reminders, etc. Please use this link to join: (https://discord.gg/WwPmHYs3qM)

Follow the instructions on the #getting-started page to get set up as a dev for 2026! After joining, please be sure you change your name in the server to the following format: Your Name (The Name of Your Game) 

If you are alumni already in the Indies Server: please go to the #getting-started page and select the appropriate dev tag.

We recommend downloading the Discord App to have on your mobile device during MAGFest as this will be our main mode of communication during the event.


### Selling

You should have already completed the Selling section of your checklist. You can view your checklist at {{ c.URL_BASE }}/guests/index?id={{ game.studio.group.guest.id }}

If you are selling items at your own booth, please complete the forms under the Selling at MAGFest section of your checklist no later than Sunday, December 14th. this is a hard deadline we can not change. After completing the forms online, you will want to submit them to the MAGFest portal as well as bring a copy of your temporary license to the event to display at your booth.

If you are selling through the Indie Item Shoppe, please fill out the [Inventory Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/13qGlQgBhSLw-vtKcYL_wIjs3KmDIqJW_QS757PNU5Q8/viewform?edit_requested=true) no later than Sunday, December 14th.


### Layout

For MIVS devsv, we had an issue with the booth placement form and unfortunately need those who have strong preferences about their placement to fill out the form again. If you don't have any strong preferences, don't worry about filling it out. Please fill this out ASAP. Ideally, by Sunday, December 14th. [Booth Placement Form](https://forms.gle/QJJjcd4tWofFVLeX7)


### Cancellations

We understand emergencies happen, and they may prevent you from participating this year. If this happens, please contact us ASAP so we can allow a waitlisted developer to participate. Letting us know ahead of time leaves you on good terms with the Indies team. Being a no-show at the event places extra work on the volunteer staff and may prevent you from being part of MAGFest Indies in the future. 

If you simply need to switch out team members, your group leader can manage your studio's badges from your group management page.


### Additional Team Member Badges

This is the final week to request a badge for additional team members you did not add to your studio before the event sold out. If you need an extra badge, please email indies@magfest ASAP.


### Indie Green Room, Discussion Groups, and Press

After last year's success, we will once again have an indie green room suite outside of the main event space for the entirety of the event. In addition to taking a break and socializing with your fellow indies, we'd like to give you the opportunity to use the space for any special interest discussion groups or jam sessions that require a quieter atmosphere.

If you're interested in using the suite, we'd love to put your event on our schedule! Some examples of how the space has been used in the past: An accessibility in alt.ctrl hardware discussion; a work-in-progress games show and tell; interviews for game dev academic research; press/podcast interviews; etc. 

If you are interested in leading a discussion or event in the suite, please would like us to reach out to, please fill out the [Suite Content Form](https://forms.gle/k41vRSF2QSpwkrG87). Additionally, if you would like to put any press in contact with us, please email (or have them email) indies@magfest.org. 

We'll be building out the schedule of events over the next month! Can't wait to see what you all dream up.


### Other Questions & Live Q&A

If you have questions, you can always contact us by emailing indies@magfest.org or drop a note to us in Discord.

We will also be hosting a series of one hour live Q&A sessions in the Discord voice channels. This is the perfect time to ask the Indies team all your burning questions, especially if it's your first time with us. The next session is below. Keep an eye on the Discord for any additional sessions or updates.

Tuesday, December 16th at 7:30pm ET for both MIVS and Indie Arcade devs


### More on the horizon...

We have some other exciting opportunities in the works like an indie mixer and a developer Q&A panel with visiting schools. Stay tuned to Discord for more information as these things are finalized.


See ya real soon,
-The Indies Team
