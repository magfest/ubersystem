Thank you for your game submission ({{ game.title }}) to the MAGFest Indie Videogame Showcase (MIVS).

Your studio's entry was judged high enough to qualify for the MIVS area but we do not have enough space to host your team, so we've added you to our Waitlist.

What does this mean? If indies who have been accepted in MIVS are not able to show for any reason, we'll offer the booth space to an indie on the Waitlist.  Please fill out this quick [Waitlist Form](https://forms.gle/H8az2C9Zw6zEr4QE9) with the last date you'd like to be pulled from the Waitlist. (We're sorry but we cannot give out details regarding size of the Waitlist or entry position. Being on the Waitlist does not guarantee a place within MIVS.)

Now the great news... You can still show at MAGFest even if you do not have a full-time MIVS booth via "QuickPlay"!

QuickPlay is an area within MIVS where booths are set aside for indies to show their game for a block of time.  As an indie, you'll be able to sign up for a 2 hour block of time, with possibly more blocks depending on availability.  We will provide a 6' table, 4 chairs, and access to a power drop.  You will need to provide your own equipment.  (WIFI/Network connections will not be available.)

Signups for Quickplay will not happen online. They will only be available on-site at MAGFest in the MIVS area and will require you to have purchased a MAGFest badge.  Signups will be on a first come, first serve basis, so we recommend visiting the MIVS area at your earliest convenience after picking up your MAGFest badge.
