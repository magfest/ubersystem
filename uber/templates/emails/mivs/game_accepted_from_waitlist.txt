Congratulations!  Your game submission ({{ game.title }}) for the {{ c.ESCHATON.year }} MAGFest Indie Videogame Showcase (MIVS) is one of the games that have been accepted into the showcase.

*** YOU NEED TO CONFIRM YOUR ACCEPTANCE! ***

Please confirm that you are coming OR let us know that you cannot make it after all at {{ c.URL_BASE }}/mivs_applications/continue_app?id={{ game.studio.id }}

You have until {{ game.studio.confirm_deadline|datetime_local }} to confirm (or decline).

We'd much rather you explicitly decline than to just fade, as being prompt helps us to move indies who are on the waitlist into the showcase.

If you plan to accept, you must be available and have your space manned for "Core Hours"
Core Hours for MIVS are:

Thursday : 1pm - 7pm
Friday : 12pm - 7pm
Saturday : 12pm - 7pm
Sunday: 12pm - 2pm

More details will be sent out to all those who confirm including:
- What's included in a MIVS "booth" space
- much, much, more....

Please Note that coming off the waitlist, we cannot guarantee you the ability to purchase a Hotel room and it becomes significantly less likely if you receive this or accept after Nov 25th. Please email {{ c.MIVS_EMAIL|email_only }} if you need more information.

Again, we understand that things may come up which may prevent your team from meeting the above requirements.  If this is the case, please let us know ASAP as this will allow one of our many wait-listed entries to participate.

Telling us you aren't able to meet the requirements leaves your team on good terms with the MIVS staff; failing to show or not meeting the requirements will be taken into consideration for future events.
