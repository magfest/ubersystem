{{ attendee.first_name }},

<br/><br/>Although your group ({{ group.name}}) {{ 'cancelled their ' + c.DEALER_APP_TERM if group.status == c.CANCELLED else 'was not taken off the waitlist' }}, we think you may still want to come and enjoy all that {{ c.EVENT_NAME }} has to offer!
Therefore, we have reserved a badge for you{% if c.PRICE_BUMPS and attendee.badge_cost < c.BADGE_PRICE %} at the price of registration when you first applied{% endif %}.
Badges went to anyone in your group who had a valid email on the badge, and any unassigned badges were dropped.

<br/><br/>Please note: You are choosing to accept or decline an ATTENDEE badge at the price it would have been had you bought it instead of applying for the {{ c.DEALER_LOC_TERM }}.
  <strong>You were not accepted as a {{ c.DEALER_TERM }}, and will not have space in the {{ c.DEALER_LOC_TERM }}.</strong>

<br/><br/>Please go ahead and confirm or decline <a href="{{ c.URL_BASE }}/preregistration/confirm?id={{ attendee.id }}">your registration</a>. We hope to see you this year!
