    Some of your badges are not yet assigned to a specific person. If you assign these badges 
    now then it will take much less time for their owners to pick them up at the festival. 
    Preassigning badges also allows individual members of your group to purchase a merch package 
    or donate extra money to {{ c.EVENT_NAME }}. You may preassign your badges on your <a href="{{ c.URL_BASE }}/preregistration/group_members?id={{ group.id }}">group management page</a>. The individual registration links on the group management page can be filled out by you, or distributed to your group members for them to fill out themselves.

If you would like to add badges, then please email us as {{ c.MARKETPLACE_EMAIL }}.

<br/><br/>Badges are not mailed out before the event, so your group members may pick up their badge at the registration desk when they arrive at MAGFest. Inform your group to bring a photo ID{{ c.EXTRA_CHECKIN_DOCS }} to the registration desk, where they'll be provided with their badge. If anyone in your group pre-ordered a t-shirt or other merch package, they can pick those up at our merchandise booth. The location and hours of the registration desk and merchandise booth will be emailed prior to the event.
