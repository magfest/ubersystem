  <h2>MITS Waiver</h2>

  <p>Hello and Welcome to {{ c.EVENT_NAME_AND_YEAR }}!</p>
  <p>We wanted to take a moment and welcome all developers who will be promoting their games this year at the MAGFest Indie Tabletop Showcase,
    and to provide you with our short developer seller’s contract. This sheet is to establish the rules.
    Please read our {% if c.CODE_OF_CONDUCT_URL %} <a href="{{ c.CODE_OF_CONDUCT_URL }}">full code of conduct here</a>.
    {% else %}full code of conduct, which is available at registration, or we can provide you with a copy if you ask.{% endif %}</p>

  <p>Rules/Information:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Indemnifying Waiver</strong>: I agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless MAGFest INC, the Gaylord National Resort and
      Convention Center, and their respective employees and agents against any claims or expenses arising out of the use of the exhibition
      premises, and I understand that neither MAGFest INC nor the Gaylord National Resort and Convention Center maintains insurance covering
      my property and it is my sole responsibility to obtain any such insurance.</li>
    <li>Be kind to your neighbors and respectful of space. Sometimes space can get a little tight, so be courteous to one another.</li>
    <li>Your displays and products cannot block the aisles or walkways. This is a big deal as we must comply with fire code. Please consult
      us before moving any tables. Your tables or belongings may be moved by us at any time if they violate fire code.</li>
    <li>You can set up and leave anytime the room is open. —there are no set demo hours. As a note: most of our crowd are not morning people
      and tend to be around between late morning and late at night. Your best hours will probably be afternoon and evening, but it is up to
      you how long you want to be there. Also, we encourage you to check out our other events when you are not demoing or selling. Your badge
      will get you entry into any and all events. Please be ready to leave the room at 4AM each night, except on Sunday, when the room will
      close for good at 6pm.</li>
    <li>You may only sell your game and related merch, and nothing else, and only if you clicked 'yes' to the 'would like to sell' questions
      in the form AND filled out the tax form before January 3rd.</li>
    <li>No selling out of a hotel room, away from the demo area or away from your table; i.e. no peddling.</li>
    <li>There is no security provided for tables in the demo area. Have a lockdown plan for when you leave or take your stuff with you.
      MAGFest is not responsible for lost or stolen property. You’re welcome to leave your things locked up in the room overnight but we
      are not guarding the room, only locking it.</li>
    <li>If you would like to lend or donate any games to our Tabletop library, that would give more people a chance to play it. Please include
      detailed instructions as you won’t be able to walk through people who borrow the game from us.</li>
    <li>We have <strong>M-Points</strong> at MAGFest—it’s our own type of “MAG Money.” Basically, we will be rewarding attendees with it
      during the event, and it works as a voucher. The denominations are as follows: 1, 5, 10, and 20. It will be up to you as to whether or
      not you want to participate in using them at your table. What will happen is an attendee will come to your table and purchase something,
      and give you the M-Point as the equivalent of cash (so a 5 M-Point for $5). You can exchange the M-Points you’ve collected for their cash
      value with a marketplace manager at the marketplace HQ table in the marketplace, I plan to be in the room from 1-7 each day and you will
      have my phone number, if you need any help with this process. It is completely voluntary as to whether or not you participate in the usage
      of M-Points. Also, you can choose to accept them one of two ways: 1.) You can give change for them if one is spent at your table
      (someone buys $2.98 worth of stuff, and gives you a 5 M-Point and you give them back $2.02 in cash) or 2.) You tell them they have
      to spend at least the value of the M-Point or otherwise they forfeit their change (i.e. they have to spend at least $5 if they want
      to use their 5 M-Point or lose the change if they only spend say $2.98). The attendee must surrender the M-Point at time of purchase.</li>
    <li>Do not try to solve a dispute with an attendee or other team at any time, get us to do this for you. You are not on-duty MAGFest staff
      while presenting.</li>
    <li>You are required to sign your vendor contract before you set up sell at your table. If you sell at your table before signing your
      contract, then you will be fined <strong>$75.00</strong>, which must be paid before you sell anything else. We’re sorry to be so harsh,
      but this is a serious matter for MAGFest as we need to follow both hotel guidelines and Maryland law.</li>
    <li>If you do not adhere to the rules set out in this contract, we reserve the right to revoke your ability to demo or sell at MAGFest
      at any time for any reason.</li>
  </ul>
