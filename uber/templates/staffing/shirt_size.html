<h2> Tell Us Your Shirt Size </h2>

<p>One of the perks of volunteering is a tshirt for anyone who takes at least {{ c.HOURS_FOR_SHIRT }} weighted hours worth of shifts.</p>

{% if attendee.gets_staff_shirt and c.STAFF_EVENT_SHIRT_OPTS %}
    <h3>Staff Shirt Policy</h3>
    <p>
        Event staff are given a themed staff t-shirt that serves as a uniform for the event, and is theirs to keep forever.
        We ask that all staff wear their staff shirt whenever they are on shift so that they are easily identifiable at a
        distance by attendees, security, and fellow staff. While wearing the staff shirt, people may be more likely to ask
        you for assistance, but don't panic! We'll provide a map and schedule for you to carry, which should answer most
        questions, and we recommend downloading the event Guidebook app as well. When in doubt, the only two things you
        really need to know are the location of the info desk and the location of security, so that you can direct the
        person to someone who can provide more assistance.
    </p>
    <p><b>When you are off-shift, please do not wear the staff shirt unless you are prepared to provide assistance.</b></p>
    <p><i>
        PRO-TIP: Wearing a long sleeve thermal shirt beneath the staff shirt can help keep you warm, keep the staff
        shirt fresh through the event, and make it easier to take off the staff shirt at the end of your shift.
    </i></p>
    <p>
        Staff shirts help make the event a more safe and welcome place to be, and while we strongly prefer you to wear
        a staff shirt while on shift, you are not required to do so. We understand that you may not be comfortable with
        people approaching you, or that your shift may have a level of sensitivity which requires that you not be obviously
        identifiable as staff. If you strongly dislike t-shirts, check with your department head to see if they can provide
        you with a visibility vest while on shift. 
    </p>
    <p>
        To prevent confusion, please do not wear a previous year's staff shirt at this event, whether or not you are on shift.
        <b>If you are wearing an old staff shirt, you may be asked to change.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        As staff, you receive two complimentary shirts, and since you'll be potentially wearing the staff shirt a substantial
        portion of the event, we give you the option for both of them to be the staff shirt design.
