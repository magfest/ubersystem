<h2>Volunteers With Alarming Hours</h2>

The following {{ flagged|length }} volunteers have signed up for at least 13 hours worth of shifts within an 18-hour window
(note that these are wall-clock hours since we don't care about weighting for this report):
<table style="width:auto">
    {% for attendee in flagged %}
        <tr>
            <td><a href="#attendee_form?id={{ attendee.id }}&tab_view=Shifts">{{ attendee.full_name }}</a>:</td>
            <td>{{ attendee.hours|length }} total (wall-clock) hours</td>
        </tr>
    {% endfor %}
</table>

{% endblock %}
