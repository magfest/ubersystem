<h2>Associate "{{ app.name }}" with an event on the schedule</h2>

Use the form below to associate this application with an event on the schedule.  Doing so will have two effects:
<br/> <br/>
<ol>
    <li>
        The primary contact for this panel ({{ app.submitter.full_name }}) will be emailed to let them know the start/stop time
        of their panel and its location (e.g. "Panels 1").
        {% if c.PANEL_SCHEDULED_EMAIL_APPROVED %}
            This email will be sent out immediately.
        {% else %}
            This will will NOT be sent out immediately; it will be queued until this category of emails is approved, which
            may be done <a href="../email_admin/pending">here</a>.
        {% endif %}
        <br/> </br>
    </li>
    <li>
        Each panelist will be added to the list of assigned panelists for this event, which is mainly used to detect when
        multiple panels have been scheduled simultaneously with the same people.

        {% if app.matched_attendees %}
            Here is a list of everyone who will be added as an assigned panelist to this event:
            <ul>
            {% for attendee in app.matched_attendees %}
                <li>{{ attendee|form_link }}</li>
            {% endfor %}
            </ul>
        {% endif %}

        {% if app.unmatched_applicants %}
            <div style="color:red"> <br/>
                <b>WARNING:<b/> {{ app.unmatched_applicants|length }} panel applicant{{ app.unmatched_applicants|length|pluralize }}
                NOT associated with an attendee.  This applicant will NOT be set as an assigned panelist.  Before associating this
                panel with an event on the schedule, you should probably make sure they are correctly matched to attendees in our
                database <a href="badges">using this form</a>.  Here is the list of panel applicants not matched:
                <ul>
                {% for applicant in app.unmatched_applicants %}
                    <li>{{ applicant.full_name }}</li>
                {% endfor %}
                </ul>
            </div>
        {% endif %}
        <br/>
    </li>
</ol>

<form method="post" action="associate">
    {{ csrf_token() }}
    <input type="hidden" name="id" value="{{ app.id }}" />
    <select name="event_id">
        <option value="">Select an event</option>
        {% for event in panels %}
            <option value="{{ event.id }}">{{ event.name }} [{{ event.location_label }}] ({{ event.timespan() }})</option>
        {% endfor %}
    </select>
    <input type="submit" value="Associate" />
</form>
