        <h3>How do panel emails work?</h3>

        Some actions such as approving a panel application will trigger an automated email.  However, simply performing the action
        doesn't necessarily cause the email to be sent out - it merely causes it to be queued for sending.  It will remain queued
        until its category is approved.

        <br/> </br>

        Here's the current status of the card-related emails:
        <ul>
            <li>Panel Declined: {{ emails['panel_declined']|yesno("approved,queued") }}</li>
            <li>Panel Waitlisted: {{ emails['panel_waitlisted']|yesno("approved,queued") }}</li>
            <li>Panel Accepted: {{ emails['panel_accepted']|yesno("approved,queued") }}</li>
            <li>Panel Scheduled: {{ emails['panel_scheduled']|yesno("approved,queued") }}</li>
        </ul>
    </body>
