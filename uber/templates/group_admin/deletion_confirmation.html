<h2> Confirm Deletion of {{ group.name }} </h2>

This group still has unassigned badges:
<ul>
    {% for attendee in group.attendees %}
        {% if not attendee.is_unassigned %}
            <li> <a href="#attendee_form?id={{ attendee.id }}">{{ attendee.full_name }}</a> </li>
        {% endif %}
    {% endfor %}
</ul>
<br/>

Deleting this group will also delete all of these badges and anything linked to them (e.g. volunteer shifts).  This often isn't a good idea, but if you're sure you know what you're doing, click the button below:
<form method="post" action="delete">
{{ csrf_token() }}
<input type="hidden" name="id" value="{{ group.id }}" />
<input type="hidden" name="confirmed" value="true" />
<input type="submit" value="Delete Group and All Its Badges" />
</form>

{% endblock %}
