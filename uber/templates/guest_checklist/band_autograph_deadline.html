<p>Note: You are allowed to have both an autograph session with the Autographs Department and a Meet & Greet in Rock Island or any other combination.  Autographs should only be done at these two locations.</p>

<p>The Rock Island Meet & Greet is a chance to sign merch purchased during the event, pose for pictures, and generally have a chance to talk to your fans after the show.  This will occur in the Rock Island area of the Main Concert Hall.</p>

<p>The Autograph Session is a more formal signing session designed to be a quieter, more intimate experience for attendees and performers. Autograph sessions can occur any time throughout the weekend and will appear on the schedule. Sessions are held in Autographs, located in Expo E.</p>
