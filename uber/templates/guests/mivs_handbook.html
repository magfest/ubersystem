  <h3>Indies Handbook and Communication Tools</h3>

  <p>The Indie Handbook and communication tools are here to give you information about being an Indies participant.</p>

  <p>We use Discord as our primary means of communication during the event and we host Q&A's leading up to the event in the voice channels. The Discord is also a great way to start networking not just with this year's showcasing devs, but with alumni developers. You can join the Discord here: <a href="https://discord.gg/Mw5ArhYzQQ" target="_blank">https://discord.gg/Mw5ArhYzQQ</a></p>

  <p>Please read through the entire handbook corresponding to your showcase area so that you know what is expected of you and your team at MAGFest.</p>
