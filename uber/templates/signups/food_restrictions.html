<h2> Dietary Restrictions </h2>

{% if attendee.badge_type == c.GUEST_BADGE %}
We feed our guests three meals per day during {{ c.EVENT_NAME }}, and our chefs have an easier time planning meals
when they know what kind of food restrictions everyone has.
{% else %}
Thanks for volunteering, welcome to the fold! Please let us know any dietary restrictions or allergies below.
<br/> Volunteers who have met hour requirements for food will be served 3 meals a day and have access to staff suite 24 hours a day!
