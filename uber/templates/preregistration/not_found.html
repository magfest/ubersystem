    <h2 class="h3">Confirmation Number Not Valid: {{ id }}</h2>

    <p>
      The {{ c.EVENT_NAME }} confirmation number {{ id }} you are trying to access is not valid.<br>
      If your registration was not found in our database, it could be because:
      <ul>
        <li>It was a duplicate of another registration and was deleted</li>
        <li>It was canceled before payment went through</li>
        <li>You asked to no longer receive emails from us and missed a confirmation email</li>
        <li>This confirmation # was for a registration that was part of a group and the group owner deleted the registration</li>
        <li>You clicked on a confirmation link for a registration from a different event</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      If you think you should have a valid registration, don't panic! You are probably just on the wrong page.
      Please contact us at {{ c.REGDESK_EMAIL }} and we're happy to look into it for you.
