    <h3>Confirmation Number Not Valid: {{ id }}</h3>

    <p>The confirmation number {{ id }} you are trying to access is not valid.<br/>
        If your badge was not found in our database, it could be because:
        <ul>
            <li>It was a duplicate of another badge and was deleted</li>
            <li>It was canceled before payment went through</li>
            <li>You asked to no longer receive emails from us and missed a confirmation email</li>
            <li>This badge was part of a group and the group owner deleted the badge</li>
            <li>You clicked on a confirmation link for a badge from a different event</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>If you think you should have a valid badge, don't panic! You are probably just on the wrong page.
        Please contact us at {{ c.REGDESK_EMAIL }} and we're happy to look into it for you.</p>
