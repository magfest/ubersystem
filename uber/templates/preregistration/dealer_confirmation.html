    <h2>{% if group.status == c.WAITLISTED %}You've been added to our waitlist!{% else %}Thanks for applying as a Dealer!{% endif %}</h2>

    We've received your application for {{ group.name }} to purchase a Dealer registration for {{ c.EVENT_NAME }}.

    <br/><br/>
    {% if group.status == c.WAITLISTED %}
        Since the Marketplace is currently full, you've been added to our waitlist, and we'll let you know if a spot opens up for you.
    {% else %}
        We receive a flood of applications every year, so application processing takes a considerable amount of time.
        Approvals will be done as promptly as possible; usually no later than <strong>two months</strong> before the event.
    {% endif %}

    <h3>What Happens Next</h3>
    After approval, you will be emailed a link to manage your dealer registration. From this link, you will be able to:
    <ul>
        <li>Pay for your dealer registration, which includes the cost of tables and badges.</li>
        <li>Register your Dealer Assistants.</li>
        <li>After your badge and table payment is received, you may add and pay for additional Dealer Assistants.</li>
    </ul>

    Your Dealership Payment includes your table cost and all badges in your group.  After payment, you'll be sent a link
    by email to follow if you wish to later upgrade your badge. Your Dealer Assistants will be able to upgrade their own
    badges and pay for those upgrades on their own.

    <br/><br/>Later, you will receive another email with more specific information about this year's event.

    <br/><br/>In the event we cannot accommodate your Dealership, you will receive an email. If your application
    is not approved, you will be able to purchase badges for yourself and the number of assistants on the application
    at the pre-registration price of ${{ c.BADGE_PRICE }} when the waitlist is exhausted. You will receive an email
    when these badges are available for purchase.
