    <h2> Credit Card Retry Failed </h2>
    <p>
      You've been redirected here because there was a problem with your credit card transaction and you (probably) hit refresh
      in your browser to retry.  To avoid any problems with accidentally double-charging anyone, our software never tries to
      make the same charge twice.  If you're sure that your original submission didn't go through (you'll receive an email
      within a few minutes if it did), you can hit the back button and re-submit the form manually.
