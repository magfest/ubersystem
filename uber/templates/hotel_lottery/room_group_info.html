<p>
    In an effort to improve overall availability of rooms, anyone planning to room together may form a group of up to four people total.
    Each individual entry in a {{ c.HOTEL_LOTTERY_GROUP_TERM|lower }} is weighted as though that person entered individually, <strong>plus an additional weighting for groups</strong>.
    This allows us to more efficiently fill rooms from the start and avoid cancellation churn.
</p>

<h3>Creating {{ c.HOTEL_LOTTERY_GROUP_TERM }}s</h3>
<p>
    To form a {{ c.HOTEL_LOTTERY_GROUP_TERM|lower }}:
    <ol>
        <li>Choose one person to be the "group leader." They will be the main responsible party, able to update the group's room and/or suite entry, and remove people from the group.</li>
        <li>Have the group leader log into their homepage and complete a lottery entry for a room and/or suite.</li>
        <li>After completing a lottery entry, the group leader will receive a confirmation email with a link to create the group and their confirmation number.</li>
        <li>After using the link to create a group, the group leader should send the other group members their confirmation number and email address.</li>
        <li>The other group members (up to three) can then log in and use the "Join {{ c.HOTEL_LOTTERY_GROUP_TERM }}" button on their lottery options page, then enter the confirmation number and email address to join the group.</li>
    </ol>
</p>

<p>
    When you join a {{ c.HOTEL_LOTTERY_GROUP_TERM|lower }}, <strong>any existing entry is automatically withdrawn from the lottery</strong>.
    For example, if you currently have a suite lottery entry, but join a group that only has a room lottery entry, you will <em>only</em> be entered into the room lottery.
</p>

<h3>Occupancy Limits</h3>
<p>
    Fire code and hotel policy typically limit king occupancy to three (3) guests.
    Some hotels limit king rooms to two (2) guests by fire code.
    Occupancy is limited to four (4) guests in all double or two-bed queen rooms. Suite occupancy varies by suite type.
    Please see <a href="{{ c.HOTEL_LOTTERY_URL }}" target="_blank">our website</a> for hotel specific occupancy information.
</p>

<p>
    If a {{ c.HOTEL_LOTTERY_GROUP_TERM|lower }} exceeds the occupancy limit of the awarded room, the group leader will be booked,
    followed by the roommates in the order they entered the lottery until the limit is met.
    Award notices will clearly show who was booked.

            <strong>We strongly encourage people rooming together to know each other well.</strong>
            Should you be uncomfortable with your roommate knowing your identity,
            or if one of your roommates is uncomfortable with sharing theirs,
            we gently suggest rooming with others may not be in your best interest.
