<h3 align="center"> Why Does {{ c.EVENT_NAME }} Need My Legal Name? </h3>

To help ensure the safety of everyone at {{ c.EVENT_NAME }}, registrations are tied to attendees using their photo ID. Attendees present their photo ID upon check-in at our registration desk.

<br/> <br/>

If you are unsure what name to use, or if your legal name is in flux, simply enter <strong>the name that will appear on your photo ID</strong> when you check in.

<br/> <br/>

If you do not enter a separate legal name, which is the likely case for most people, we will assume your preferred name is also what will appear on your photo ID.

<br/> <br/>

Both your preferred and legal name are for internal use only and will not be printed on public materials (e.g. badges, swag, etc). We will use your preferred name in emails and when interacting with you, but we still need your legal name to check you in.
