<h3 align="center"> Why Does {{ c.EVENT_NAME }} Need the Name on My ID? </h3>

To help ensure the safety of everyone at {{ c.EVENT_NAME }}, registrations are tied to attendees using their photo ID. Attendees present their photo ID upon check-in at our registration desk.

<br/> <br/>

If you are unsure what name to use, or if your legal name is in flux, simply enter <strong>the name that will appear on your photo ID</strong> when you check in.

<br/> <br/>

If your first and last names are <em>exactly</em> as they appear on your photo ID, you can simply check the box indicating this to skip filling in a separate name.

<br/> <br/>

The name on your ID is for internal use only and will not be printed on public materials. We will use your first and last name in emails and when interacting with you, and may print it in cases such as when you do not enter a badge name (for personalized swag, staff badges, etc.)
