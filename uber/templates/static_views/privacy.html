If you don't opt-in to receiving emails related to {{ organization_with_event_name('or') }} in the future, then we will only
use your email address to contact you as necessary about this year's {{ c.EVENT_NAME }}, and then the
address will never again be used.

If you do opt-in to receiving emails in the future, here are some assurances:
<ul class="pad-top-10">
    <li> Your email address will never be shared with anyone; not companies which partner with {{ organization_with_event_name('or') }}, not third parties, no one. </li>
    <li> You may opt-out of receiving further emails at any time. </li>
    <li> You will only be contacted about things relating to {{ organization_with_event_name() }}. </li>
</ul>
