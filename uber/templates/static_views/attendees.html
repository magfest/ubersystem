<h3 align="center">Attendee Badges</h3>

Although we have lots of different badge options, a regular attendee badge is
still an all-access, four-day pass to everything at {{ c.EVENT_NAME }}.  This includes
all of the things listed below, most of which are open 24-hours per day:
<ul>
    <li> console room </li>
    <li> LAN room </li>
    <li> tabletop room </li>
    <li> jam space </li>
    <li> {{ c.DEALER_LOC_TERM }} </li>
    <li> video room </li>
    <li> arcade cabinets, all on free-play </li>
    <li> all of our nightly concerts </li>
    <li> entry into any tournament </li>
    <li> panels, presentations, contests, and game shows </li>
    <li> special Challenges Booth </li>
</ul>
