<h3 align="center"> Supporter Badges </h3>

For years we've offered a special Supporter registration as a way for dedicated fans of
MAGFest to give us a little extra cash to help make the festival better.  This is now
offered as one of our <a href="givingExtra.html">donation levels</a>, and you'll get all
of the extra swag we've always given.

<br/> <br/>

The main things you get as a Supporter are a special swag bag and a cool customized badge.
As with all donation levels, you still get all of the swag from the lower donation levels,
and if you donate at a higher level, you still get the Supporter package.

If you're interested in an even higher level of support, then check out our
