# The reason these are separate is because sometimes the description might
# contain things that we don't physically hand out at the merch booth.

# This section is for defining option sets which are used for dropdowns and

# one.  For example, the [[badge]] subsection will generate a BADGE_OPTS list
# and a BADGES dictionary, and the [[access]] subsection will generate ACCESS
# and ACCESS_OPTS, etc.
#
# All of the options in each subsection will become integer global contants
# which will be the values used to store these fields in the database and to

# displaying these values to users; see the {{ options() }} tag and the _label
# properties for how to use these.
#
# Some of the subsections have values defined here, because it would break our
# code to have any of their options removed.  For example, we MUST have an
# ATTENDEE_BADGE option, though you can override the display text.  You can
# also add new option to those sections, e.g. new badge types and ribbons.  In
# theory you can also REMOVE items which are already defined here by setting
# their description value to the empty string.  You should only do this if
# you're really sure that you know what you're doing, since removing options
