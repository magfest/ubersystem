[donation_tier_descriptions]
# Sometimes the items in the [[donation_tier]] subsection of [integer_enums]
# need extra information beyond just the amount and name of the donation level.
# The two fields with semantic meaning to our merch booth are the "description"
# and "items" fields.  When someone comes to collect their merch, it's useful to
# not just say the donation level (e.g. "Supporter Pack") but to individually
# list the items.  This helps prevent new volunteers from accidentally failing
# to give out all of the items in the pack.
#
# The subsection names here can be anything; the "name" field is used to map
# each subsection to the donation tier.  For example, if we had the following
# donation tiers:
#   [integer_enums]
#   [[donation_tier]]
#   "No thanks" = 0
#   "Have some money" = 10
#   "Shirt" = SHIRT_LEVEL
#   "Supporter Pack" = SUPPORTER_LEVEL
#
# We might see the following tier descriptions:
#   [donation_tier_descriptions]
#   [[minimum_kickin]]
#   name = "Have some money"
#   description = "Our Gratitude|Cool Throw-ins"
#   merch_items = "Friend of the Event Ribbon", "Sticker Pack"
#   [[supporter]]
#   name = "Supporter Pack"
#   description = "Supporter Bag|Custom Poncho"
#
# The "description" field is a "|"-separated list (TODO: replace this with an
# actual list).  We split this and use it to show which merch items should be
# distributed, unless the "merch_items" field is set, in which case we use that.
# The reason these are separate is because sometimes the description might
# contain things that we don't physically hand out at the merch booth.
#
# In addition to everything described above, event-specific plugins can place
# additional information here to power custom Javascript on their registration
# page.  For example, the "magprime" plugin adds "icon" and "link" fields to
# each subsection.

# This section is for defining option sets which are used for dropdowns and
# checkbox groups.  Every sub-section will be turned into two global constants;
# a list of key/value tuples and a dictionary.  The former will have the "opts"
# suffix and the latter will have an "s" appended if it doesn't already end with
# one.  For example, the [[badge]] subsection will generate a BADGE_OPTS list
# and a BADGES dictionary, and the [[access]] subsection will generate ACCESS
# and ACCESS_OPTS, etc.
#
# All of the options in each subsection will become integer global contants
# which will be the values used to store these fields in the database and to
# otherwise identify these values in the code.  The string values are used for
# displaying these values to users; see the {{ options() }} tag and the _label
# properties for how to use these.
#
# Some of the subsections have values defined here, because it would break our
# code to have any of their options removed.  For example, we MUST have an
# ATTENDEE_BADGE option, though you can override the display text.  You can
# also add new option to those sections, e.g. new badge types and ribbons.  In
# theory you can also REMOVE items which are already defined here by setting
# their description value to the empty string.  You should only do this if
# you're really sure that you know what you're doing, since removing options
# which the core system relies upon could cause all kinds of problems.
