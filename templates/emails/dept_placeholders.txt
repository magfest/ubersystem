MAGFest is just around the corner, and we still have a lot of staffers who have been invited back who haven't told us whether or not they're coming.  As a department head, we were hoping you could take a look at the unconfirmed staffers both in your department and elsewhere to see if there are any names you recognize.
{% if attendee.assigned_depts|dept_placeholders %}
Below is a list of the unconfirmed staffers in your department.  If you know any of them personally, we'd appreciate it if you could reach out to them and get them to let us know whether or not they're coming to MAGFest this year.{% for placeholder in attendee.assigned_depts|dept_placeholders %}
- {{ placeholder.full_name }} ({{ URL_BASE }}/registration/form?id={{ placeholder.id }}){% endfor %}
{% else %}
There are no unconfirmed staffers in {{ attendee.assigned_display.0 }}, but we'd appreciate it if you looked through the list of unconfirmed staffers below to see if there's anyone you recognize.  If you know any of them personally, we'd appreciate it if you could reach out to them and get them to let us know whether or not they're coming to MAGFest this year.
{% endif %}
Here's the list of unconfirmed staffers from all departments:{% for placeholder in None|dept_placeholders %}
- {{ placeholder.full_name }} ({{ URL_BASE }}/registration/form?id={{ placeholder.id }}){% endfor %}

Thanks for taking the time to look through this.  Please let us know if you have any questions.
